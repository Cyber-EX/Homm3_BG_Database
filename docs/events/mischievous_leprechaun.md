# Mischievous Leprechaun

Mischievous Leprechaun is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

*You are making your way through the dense forest when you stumble upon a mischievous magical creature - a leprechaun sitting on a pile of treasures.<br>"Answer my question and I shall part with some of these worthless trumpery. Now... what do I have in my pocket?"*


## Effect

Pool 2 [:treasure:](../dice.md#treasure-die) and 2 [:trasuredie:](../dice.md#resource-die), roll them, and put them within all players' reach. Starting from the player who drew this event, each player rolls 1 [:treasure:](../dice.md#treasure-die) and 1 [:trasuredie:](../dice.md#resource-die). If they can match any of the pool's rolls, they may take one matching die from the pool and resolve its effects.
