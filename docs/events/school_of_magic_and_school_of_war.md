# School of Magic and School of War

School of Magic and School of War is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

**On your journey you happen upon two majestic buildings from which two figures emerge - an acolyte whose mere presence fills the air with a tingle of magic and  a battle-scarred instructor, grunting between sentences. The both shout at passers-by: "Come and learn the secrets of mystical arts!" "No! Fancy tricks are for the weak. I touch what real warriors need!"**


## Effect

**Each player chooses one option:** <br>Discard as many cards as you want, then draw new cards up to your :hand: +2. Remove any number of Ability or Spell cards from your hand. For every two cards removed this way, you can perform **Search (2)** the Ability deck or the Spell deck.<br><br>— OR —<br><br>Leave and gain nothing.
