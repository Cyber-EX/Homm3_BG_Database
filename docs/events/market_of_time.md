<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>**Each player chooses one option:** <br>Discard as many cards as you want, then draw new cards up to your :hand: +2. Remove any number of [Ability](../abilities/index.md) or [Spell](../spells/index.md) cards from your hand. For every two cards removed this way, you can perform **Search (2)** the [Artifact](../artifacts/index.md) deck.<br><br>— OR —<br><br>Leave and gain nothing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>*In the middle of a small town, you stumble upon a bustling and noisy market. Lured by the cheerful atmosphere, you start walking around. Each item on the display seems weird...<br>...after hours of wandering, you find yourself in the middle of the road, not sure when you left the market. When you turn around, you see just an empty road... not even a town in sight. Was all of that just a dream?*</p>
