# Prison

Prison is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

*In the town you have passed recently, you heard rumors of some people from your lands having been imprisoned by a local governor. In a dazzling display of daring, you break into the jail and free all imprisoned there. In return, some of them pledge loyalty to your cause.*


## Effect

Draw 2 [Neutral Unit](../units/index.md) cards from any deck (except for Azure). You can buy one of them or discard it to gain 3 :gold:. After that, pass the remaining card to the next player. That player also draws a [Neutral Unit](../units/index.md) card from any deck (except for Azure) and repeats the rest of the process. The exchange goes on till every player has a chance to choose something.
