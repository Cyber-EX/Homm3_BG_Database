# Shrine of the Magic Thought

Shrine of the Magic Thought is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

*You come across a lavish shrine attended by a group of high priests. Their eyes are full of fear, and they beg you to chase away nearby monsters. In exchange for protection, they agree to teach you a sophisticated spell.*


## Effect

For every player in the game, draw two random [Spell](../spells/index.md) cards and place them face-up within all players' reach. Each player can either buy one of these [:spellpower:](../spells/index.md) for 6 :gold: or 2 :valuables: or roll and resolve 1 [:trasuredie:](../dice.md#resource-die). Place the remaining, not bought, cards in the [Spell](../spells/index.md) discard pile.
