# Magical Forest

Magical Forest is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

*The sound of music lures you into a magical forest where you see a young person running through the wood. The elusive silhoutte disappears whenever you get closer. Finally, you catch up and grab their arm... only to wake up and discover you wwere unconcious for several hours. Dejected, you rise from the moss with a strange feeling that something has changed.*
