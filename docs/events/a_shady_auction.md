# A Shady Auction

A Shady Auction is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

*In the depth of the night, you come across a crowdy camp encircling a stage. On it, a corpulent man with a twirly mustache is shouting vigorously, "...and the vase goes to the lovely beared lady in the back row! Now gaze upon this marvelous item I shed tears and blood to get! Not mine of course... The starting price is..."*


## Effect

Repeat 3 times: Reveal the top card from the [Artifact](../artifacts.md) deck. In secret, each player takes as much :gold: in their hand as they are willing to pay for it. Then reveal your bets at the same time. The one with the highest proposal discards the :gold: and claims the card. If there are no bets or there is a tie, discard the card.
