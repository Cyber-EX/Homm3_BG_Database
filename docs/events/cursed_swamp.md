# Cursed Swamp

Cursed Swamp is an event that comes with the [Fortress Expansion](../content.md).

**On your journey, you wander into a swamp. Only after some time do you notice the eerie atmosphere surrounding this place and the eyes lurking just beneath the water's surface. Eyes of the dead. Your army tremples in panic while you gather your thoughts. Will you force them to go on or, maybe, shield them with your magic?**
