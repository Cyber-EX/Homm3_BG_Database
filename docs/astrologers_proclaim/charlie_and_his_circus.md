The Players must still :pay: the recruitment cost and have the corresponding [Dwelling](../towns/index.md) in their [Town(s)](../towns/index.md).

## Notes

- :azure: units may *not* be recruited via this card.
- [^1] When played with miniatures (e.g. such as when playing on the large battlefield), this ability cannot be used to recruit units from a faction controller by another player, nor to recruit neutral units that are already recruited by another player. Should a player draw such card, that may not be recruited, they shall draw a replacement card instead.
