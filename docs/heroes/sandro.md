## Notes

- Cloak of the Undead King Ⅰ and Ⅳ - this can only be played on a pack of Skeletons or Zombies, adding another amount to them, named "Horde".
- Cloak of the Undead King Ⅳ - the abilities of the Pack of Zombies become inactive if they are upgraded to a "Horde". Once the "Horde" is defeated and they become a "Pack" again, their abilities function as usual.
- Cloak of the Undead King Ⅵ - any amount of Skeletons may be upgraded to a "Legion". If the Skeletons are upgraded to a "Legion", they may be further upgraded to a "Pack" or a "Horde", but the "Legion" stays on top and its statistics are applied until defeated.
