<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>*A little leprechaun dances gleefully around a magical sack. Seeing you approach, he stops in mid-stride. The little man screams and stamps his foot ferociously, vanishing into thin air. Remembering the old leprechaun saying, 'Finders Keepers', you grab the sack and leave.*</p>
