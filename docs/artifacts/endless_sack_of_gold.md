# Endless Sack of Gold

Endless Sack of Gold is a relic artifact that comes with the [Core Game](../content.md).

*A little leprechaun dances gleefully around a magical sack. Seeing you approach, he stops in mid-stride. The little man screams and stamps his foot feriociously, vanishing into thin air. Remembering the old leprechaun saying, 'Finders Keepers', you grab the sack and leave.*
