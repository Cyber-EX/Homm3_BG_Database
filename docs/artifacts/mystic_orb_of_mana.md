# Mystic Orb of Mana

Mystic Orb of Mana is a major artifact that comes with the [Tower Expansion](../content.md).

*You come upon a caravan of gypsies who are feasting and fortifying their bodies with mead. They call you forward and say, "If you prove that you can dance the Rama-Buta, we will reward you." You don't know it, but try anyway. They laugh hysterically, but admire your bravery, giving you a strange orb.*
