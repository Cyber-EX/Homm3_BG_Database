## Notes

- This artifact only recudes the recruitment cost, it does not allow for an additional recruitment to take place. During a round in which the player already recruited units (their population marker is already turned over), the discount effect provides no benefit, as the player may no longer recruit.
- The recruitment discount may be played in combination with cards that allow recruitment (e.g. [Necromancy](../abilities/necromancy.md)).
- Should the player recruit outside of their turn, the effect of the Arms of Legion may not be used.
