## Notes

- With the first effect, only [abilities](../abilities/index.md), [artifacts](../artifacts/index.md), and [spells](../spells/index.md) can be exchanged, as only those have a corresponding deck to draw from. [Statistics](../statistics/index.md) and [specialties](../heroes/index.md) can not be removed.
- [^1] With the second effect, any card may be removed together with the Spellbinder's Hat.
