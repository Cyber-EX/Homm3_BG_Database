## Notes

- Liches can only do one extra attack, not more.
- The extra attacks of Liches also trigger when attacking an adjacent target.
- Should the Liches attack a unit and there is only a friendly unit adjacent to their target, then the friendly unit will be the target of their secondary attack.
- Should the Liches attack an adjacent unit, and there is no other unit adjacent to the target, the Liches deal the damage of the second attack to themselves.
- (?) Should the Liches attack an adjacent unit, and there is another friendly unit adjacent to the target, they may target themselves for the second attack.
- (?) Should the Liches attack an adjacent unit, and the Liches die as a result of their target retaliation attack, the secondary attack is still carried out.
- (?) Only on the large Battlefield: Should the Liches attack an adjacent unit, and both them, and their target have a common adjacent enemy to them, and this common adjacent unit is dealt damage from the secondary attack, both, the original target and the target of their secondary attack perform a retaliation attack against the Liches.

*Lines prefixed with (?) are not officially confirmed by game designers, and are therefore considered Community rules.*
