## Notes

- The effect can be used at the end of each of the player's turns, as long as the Nomads are in the player's unit deck (e.g. after being recruited by [Diplomacy](../abilities/diplomacy.md)).
- After using the :effect_map:, the Nomads are not put away, but stay in the player's unit deck.
- Fields are considered empty if they can not provide an effect or no longer provide an effect. This means that fields with black cubes or the player's faction cubes count as empty.
