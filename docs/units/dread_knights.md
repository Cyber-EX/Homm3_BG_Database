## Heroes With A Specialty

- [:might: Lord Haart (Necropolis)](../heroes/lord_haart_necropolis.md#specialty)

## Notes

- [^1] **Few** - Should the Dread Knights attack neutral [Crusaders](../units/crusaders.md), when the [Crusaders](../units/crusaders.md) retaliate against a few Dread Knights, they're abilities cancel out and a single [Attack die](../dice.md#attack-die) is rolled as if it was a regular attack.
