ðŸš§ Work In Progress - Stronghold, Conflux, and Cove ðŸš§


## :attack: What Is This?

A simple collection of cards contained within the Homm3 boardgame.

Every now and then I want to see what some cards do, either while theorycrafting about what to play, or even during play, when I want to check or reference something.


## :defense: Future Plans?

* Have a separate page for each card
* Include pictures for quick visual reference
