ðŸš§ Work In Progress - Stronghold, Conflux, and Cove ðŸš§


## :attack: What Is This?

A simple collection of cards contained within the Homm3 boardgame.

Every now and then I want to see what some cards do, either while theorycrafting about what to play, or even during play, when I want to check or reference something.


## :defense: Future Plans?

* Information about origins of content - some people may not have all of the expansions and it would be nice for them to know what I have or lack.
* Rewrite card text to improve consistency and clarify issues - I value the clarity and consistency over preserving the original card text, so I will be incorporating answers and explanations by the BGG community and game designers.
* Including pictures for quick visual reference
