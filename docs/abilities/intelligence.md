- [:might: Iona](../heroes/iona.md)
- [:magic: Sephinroth](../heroes/sephinroth.md)


## Notes

- If both players are resolving cards with effects at the start of the Combat (e.g. playing Intelligence), the attacker (or the player with the initiative token) may resolve their card first.
- This ability can only be played at the start of the Combat itself, not at the start of any Combat round.
